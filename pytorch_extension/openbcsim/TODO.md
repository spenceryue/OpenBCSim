## TODO
- [x] In `Simulator.py`, separate `simulate()` into `project()` and `convolve()` steps.
  - [x] Currently, we only have `project()` being launched. `convolve()`'s job is to convolve
    - [ ] Test it
  - [x] Do Hilbert transform in convolve step
- [x] Add `LinearTransducer` feature: set focal sequence. Give a set of focal points to scan for. The total number of focal points determines the value of `num_scans`.
- [x] Allow option in `launch` to sum along receiver element dimension and allocate a smaller buffer.
  - [x] Nevermind, don't. This would prevent doing any post-processing tricks like dynamic focusing on receive.
- [x] Expose grid/block/shared mem/stream calling interface of `launch` directly to Python.
  - [x] Update `Simulator.py` to call `make_shape` and `make_grid` for reporting stats.
- [x] Rename `transmitter` and `receiver` members of `Simulator<scalar_t>` to `tx` and `rx`.
- [ ] Test it
  - [ ] Call `set_delays` and `set_apodization` for some given `focal_points`.
    - [ ] Specifically, use 50 lines at 60mm depth (or whatever Field II used), uniform apodization.
    - [ ] Use apodization to set an F-number for transmit? (N_active=64)
      - [ ] Use Hanning window
    - [ ] Use dynamic focusing on reception
  - [ ] Modify `visualize` to render the Tensor output by `launch`.
  - [ ] Compare with the results from previous `cyst_phantom` notebook.
   - [ ] Same not same? Can we say kernel behaves correctly (as expected)?
  - [ ] Set unfocused and capture planar wave.
   - [ ] Apply NUFFT to simulated data. Plot and compare.
  <STOPPED HERE 8/26/18>
- [x] Configure CTest to call `test_openbcsim.exe` with various arguments.
  - [x] Currently, getting `Exit code 0xc0000135` error. Why aren't the runtime libraries being found?
    - [x] Because semicolons were expanding `PATH` into a list in `set_test_properties()`
  - [x] [Debug] Why isn't the `result` Tensor printing in `with_pytorch()`?
    - [x] Check allocating output_buffer in `openbcsim_module.cpp:launch()`?
    - [x] Note that casting DeviceProperties() also crashes if do not first import openbcsim module. What if the DLLs of PyTorch used are different leading to this crash? (i.e. the copied ones are different from the linked ones.)
      - [x] Indeed, fixed after clearing out copied DLLs.
  - [x] [Debug] Why is `without_pytorch()` test also failing?
    - [x] Found reason: Forgot to initialize `tx.num_elements`.
- [x] Does anything work from Python side?
  - [x] Yes, seems able to launch and produce results.
- [x] Implement `__getitem__` for `DeviceProperties`.
- [ ] Package `openbcsim.<version>.pyd`, `Simulator.py`, `Transducer.py` into an easier to import unit.
